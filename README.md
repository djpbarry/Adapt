ADAPT (**A**utomated **D**etection and **A**nalysis of **P**ro**T**rusions) is a plug-in developed for the [ImageJ/FIJI](http://fiji.sc/) platform to automatically detect and analyse cell migration and morphodynamics. The program provides whole-cell analysis of multiple cells, while also returning data on individual membrane protrusion events.
